#Full Stack Application with React and Express
This project is a full-stack web application with a React frontend and an Express backend. This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and run both parts of the application.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v14 or above)
npm (Node Package Manager)
#Setting Up the Project
1. Install Backend Dependencies
Navigate to the backend directory and install the required dependencies:

cd backend
npm install
2. Install Frontend Dependencies
Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required dependencies:

cd frontend
npm install

#Run Application
Running the Application
1. Start the Backend (Express)
In the server directory, run:
cd backend
npm start
This will start the Express server. By default, it runs on http://localhost:5000.

2. Start the Frontend (React)
In the frontend directory, run:
cd frontend
npm start
This will start the React development server. By default, it runs on http://localhost:3000.

Now you can run both the frontend and backend with a single command:
npm start
This will start both the Express server and the React development server at the same time.
